# CAV-PR: An Autonomous Vehicle-captured Dataset in CERTH Premises for Place Recognition
CAV-PR (CERTH Autonomous Vehicle - Place Recognition) is a public dataset which contains sychronized sequences of RGB image, 3D Lidar, IMU and GPS-RTK measurements. It composed of two sessions and each one of them contain revisits from both same and reverse viewpoints. This is the official repository of the paper:  
[Loop closure detection with 3D LiDAR Data for Extreme Viewpoint Changes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9874344)
